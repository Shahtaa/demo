### Description:
This project is a Spring Boot application that provides a platform for managing content items. It allows users to perform CRUD operations on content items, including adding, removing, and listing them. The application uses Spring Data JPA for database access, Thymeleaf for server-side rendering of web pages, and integrates an embedded H2 database for data storage. The project aims to demonstrate best practices in Spring Boot application development, including the use of RESTful endpoints and integration of essential technologies for building robust web applications.

### Key Features:
- **Spring Boot**: Utilizes Spring Boot framework for rapid application development.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Implements data access layer with JPA (Java Persistence API) for database operations.
- **Thymeleaf**: Uses Thymeleaf as the template engine for server-side rendering of web pages.
- **H2 Database**: Integrates an embedded H2 database for lightweight development and testing.
- **CRUD Operations**: Supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing content items.
- **RESTful Endpoints**: Provides RESTful endpoints for adding, removing, and listing content.
- **Lombok**: Utilizes Lombok library to reduce boilerplate code by automatically generating getters, setters, and constructors.

### Technologies Used:
- **Java**: Programming language for backend development.
- **Spring Framework**: Provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications.
- **Spring Boot**: Facilitates quick and easy setup of Spring-based applications.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Simplifies data access by abstracting the implementation of data repositories.
- **Thymeleaf**: Server-side Java template engine for web and standalone environments.
- **H2 Database**: Lightweight, in-memory SQL database written in Java.
- **Maven**: Build automation tool for managing project dependencies and building Java projects.
- **JUnit**: Framework for unit testing Java applications.
- **Mockito**: Mocking framework for unit tests in Java.
- **Lombok**: Library for reducing boilerplate code in Java classes.
